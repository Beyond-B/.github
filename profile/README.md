1. Check your environment settings: Make sure Android Studio and JDK (Java Development Kit) are installed, and update to the latest version if necessary. Also, make sure Android Studio is set up to use Git.

2. Clone the project: Open Android Studio and select 'Check out project from Version Control', then select 'GitHub'. Enter the GitHub repository URL and clone the project to the desired directory.

3. Check Gradle settings: When you open a project, Android Studio will automatically start syncing Gradle. If your Gradle version is not 8.1.1, specify the Gradle version in the gradle-wrapper.properties file as follows:

  distributionUrl=https\://services.gradle.org/distributions/gradle-8.1.1-all.zip
  After making this change, Android Studio will try to sync Gradle again.

4. Check and sync dependencies: Review your project's build.gradle file (both project and app modules) to ensure all dependencies are set correctly and updated as necessary. Afterwards, click ‘Sync Now’ to apply the changes.

5. Run the app: Select 'Run' > 'Run 'app'' from the top menu of Android Studio, or click the 'Run' button (green triangle) on the toolbar to run the app. Before running, make sure AVD (Android Virtual Device) is set or there is an Android device connected.
